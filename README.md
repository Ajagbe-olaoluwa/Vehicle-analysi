# Introduction
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about vehicle population across various product industries and locations. The goal is to identify trends and insights to know which vehicles are the most dominating and why.  
Major tools used in this project include Excel and Power BI.

## KPI Requirements
1. **Total Vehicles:**  
   Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. **Average Electric Range:**  
   Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:**  
   Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.  
   Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:**  
   Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.  
   Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
